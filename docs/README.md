# Overview

Inspection of large terrains such as college campuses, business parks, and apartment complexes is physically demanding and time consuming. We propose a drone based solution for automating inspection using an image processing pipeline to detect anomalies and report these potential defects to a maintenance crew. Doing so will allow for more frequent inspections, access to difficult to reach areas such as rooftops, and provide insights for monitoring events over time.
